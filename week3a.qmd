# 1.How will I tackle the problem.

I will follow the instructions, use the formula to fill in the missing ratings, and select the highest predicted score from each user's unrated movies as the recommendation.

# 2.What data challenges do I may anticipate?

Since most users have only rated two movies, the bias is unstable. To improve accuracy, I might include ratings for films they haven't watched but have some knowledge of, thereby reducing the bias.
